# Baking Buddy

This application demonstrates several advanced Android programming concepts, such as fragments, tablet layouts, and automated UI tests.

It makes use of several popular Android libraries - Retrokit 2 for HTTP requests, Butterknife for data binding, and Espresso for writing
automated UI tests.

Users can watch videos to help step them through their selected recipe as well as use a widget to display its ingredients on their device's
homescreen. There are alternate layouts for landscape and tablet modes.
