# Baking Buddy

This application demonstrates several advanced Android programming concepts, such as fragments, tablet layouts, and automated UI tests.

It makes use of several popular Android libraries - [Retrofit for HTTP requests](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Butterknife for view binding](https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/),
and Espresso for writing automated UI tests.

Users can watch videos to help guide them through their selected recipes as well as use a widget to display its ingredients on their device's
homescreen. There are alternate layouts for landscape and tablet modes.
